# Dependencies
We propably use some kind of Target tree.

# Platform / OS detection
We need a way to detect the Platform and OS in lua there is no build-in way so we propably gonna use a different language for the tool itself.

# Plugin system
We will need a way to add plugins best thing is propably to copy cmake in the approach.
That way we don't need to develop a plugin repo.
