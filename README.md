Laub is a lua based project utility designed to simplify the process of managing projects.
It provides a flexible and powerful framework for automating tasks such as compiling, packaging, and testing.
It does NOT replace existing tools.
It is meant as a project manager which tells other tools what to do.

## Name Origin
The Laub project utility tool derives its name from the German word "Laub" for a stack of leaves.
This name reflects the tool's purpose: managing the many different tools and components (leaves) that make up a modern software project.
While the project name retains its German origin, all other terminology uses standard English to ensure accessibility and ease of use for the international developer community.

## Disclaimer
This Project is very ambitious and therefore will need time to evolve.
