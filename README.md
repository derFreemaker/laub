Laub is a project utility designed to simplify the process of managing projects.
It provides a flexible and powerful framework for automating tasks such as compiling, packaging, and testing.
It does NOT replace existing tools.
It is meant as a project manager which tells other tools what to do.

## Configuration Language
Lua is used to configure your project this was chosen for its ease and simplicity.
Lua also provides the direct calling of "unmanaged" functions like c or zig.
Giving you the option to write more performance orientated code in a compiled language,
keeping the overhead smaller this tool introduces.
Or just interact with other tools directly instead over the command line.

## Name Origin
The Laub project utility tool derives its name from the German word "Laub" for a stack of leaves.
This name reflects the tool's purpose: managing the many different tools and components (leaves) that make up a modern software project.
While the project name retains its German origin, all other terminology uses standard English to ensure accessibility and ease of use for the international developer community.

## Disclaimer
This Project is very ambitious and therefore will need time to evolve.
